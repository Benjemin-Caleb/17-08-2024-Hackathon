****--Overview--****
This project implements an advanced Waste Management System using Python, focusing on electronic devices (E-devices). The system tracks the lifespan of electronic items, determines when they are due for replacement, and calculates a sustainability score to promote responsible e-waste management.


**--Features--**

**User Authentication:**
Users can create accounts and log in with their credentials.
User data, including login credentials and device information, is securely stored in a JSON file.
Persistent storage allows data to be retrieved and reused across different sessions, even after re-running the code.

**Device Management:**
Users can add electronic devices, specifying the purchase date and expected lifespan.
The system calculates the age of each device and determines if it is due for replacement.
A sustainability score is generated based on the proportion of devices that are still within their expected lifespan.

**Automated Data Handling:**
All user and device data is automatically saved in JSON format, enabling persistent storage and retrieval without the need for external databases.
The system ensures that the data provided is securely stored and can be accessed or modified in future sessions.


****Technologies Used:****
Programming Language: Python
Data Storage: JSON
